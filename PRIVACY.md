# Privacy Policy — why am i here

Last updated: 2026-02-16

why am i here is a browser extension that helps users browse intentionally by showing an intention prompt and timer on selected domains.

## What data we handle
The extension stores the following data locally in your browser:
- Target domains selected by the user
- Intention text entered in the overlay
- Timer selections and active timer state
- Local analytics events (for example: overlay shown, intention submitted, timer started/expired), including domain and timestamps
- UI preferences (for example: theme)

## How we use data
We use this data only to provide core extension features:
- Show the overlay on selected domains
- Start and manage timers
- Display local Insights/analytics pages
- Restore active state in the current tab/session

## Data sharing
- We do not sell user data.
- We do not transfer user data to third parties.
- We do not use user data for advertising or profiling.

## Remote code and external services
The extension does not load remote executable code and does not require external analytics or tracking services for core functionality.

## Data retention and deletion
Data remains in browser local storage until you remove it:
- You can clear analytics from the Insights page.
- You can remove configured domains in Options.
- Uninstalling the extension removes extension data from your browser.
