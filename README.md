# why am i here

A gentle browser extension that turns autopilot browsing into intentional time.

## What it does
When you open a site you chose (e.g. youtube.com, reddit.com), the page pauses and asks one simple question:
"Why am I here?"
You write a short intention to continue, and a small pill stays visible as a reminder while you browse.
Insights summarizes what happens on those domains over time (no-intention rate, counts, and common intentions).

## How it works
1. Add the domains you want to be more mindful about.
2. The overlay appears on those domains.
3. You enter an intention to proceed.
4. A floating pill keeps your intention visible.
5. Optional timebox: pick 5/10/20/custom minutes. When it ends, the prompt returns.
6. Review Insights to spot patterns and tune your domain list.

## Privacy
All data stays local in your browser (including Insights). No cloud, no tracking, no ads.
