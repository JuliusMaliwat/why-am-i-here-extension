# why am i here

A browser extension that adds a short pause before distraction sites, then keeps your intention visible while you browse.

## What it does
When you open a domain in your target list (for example `youtube.com` or `reddit.com`), the page is paused and asks:
"Why am I here?"
You submit an intention, start a timer, and continue with a small floating reminder pill.
Insights shows whether visits were intentional over time, plus common intentions by domain.

## How it works
1. Add the domains you want to guard.
2. On those domains, the overlay blocks background interaction.
3. Write an intention and submit.
4. Pick a timebox (`5m`, `10m`, `20m`, or custom minutes).
5. If you try to continue without selecting a timer, a quick math check appears and starts a default 1 minute timer after a correct answer.
6. Keep browsing with a visible intention pill and countdown.
7. When the timer expires, the prompt returns so you can recommit.
8. Review Insights to see trend, no-intention rate, and top intentions.
